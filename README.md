this my scratch to remmember object orientied in java:
I really suggest to watch this :

for experience programmer this course really good to you, it's give you quick and deep enough understanding about :

1. object and classes including inheritance concept and that class interaction like class properties vs object properties (static), overiding, overloading, access parent class, and side effect like field shadowing phenomena and some technical asspect like final field.
2. Polymorfisme, still relation with poin number 1, but it's give you more understanding how to safe way to do that while type casting and type check.
3. Package and Access modifier, this video is give you understanding how package works and enclaptulation  concept is working by using access modifier.
4. Abstract Class and Interface, another type of polymorfisme, it's give you more advance concept about polymorfisme, sometimes some object is have deep relation ship with one object (inheritance concept), but sometime some object just enough to have additional functionality (interface concept). This video is give you too, technical aspect like default method in interface, final keyword of class and method, and anonymous class to implement interface.
5. Inner class, another part of enclaptulation, somethimes we need some object can access another object properties that not want to share it in public way, we can embed an class in a class so the inner class can access the outer class properties, this can improve readable and maintainable code too.

   Additional part :
6. toString, equals, hashCode method, this video is give you brief information some important method that ussually used by java to printing and comparing object, and how java do eficiency store data while using hashCode that can lead potantial issue while comparing data.
7. Enum class, special type of class that used to option values.
8. Throwable Exception, Runtime Execption, Runtime Exception but fatal err, it's give you understanding category of exception in java and how to handle it, and some techinal aspect how to release resources that need to be closed while err hapen in execution process, tracing error.
9. Annotation and Reflection, this video give understanding how to add metadata / flag in our class, method, or field that can used in runtime process by reflection, that we can add logic based on the flag and value from field, in this video it's give you example to create validation based on annotation.
